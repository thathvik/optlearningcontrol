    "c) using the previous computations, the classes above (optional) and code skeleton below (also optional), implement the REINFORCE algorithm for the inverted pendulum. Use $\\alpha = 0.99$, an episode length of 100 (i.e. 10 seconds) and order p=2 for the policy approximation. Hint: you may want to choose a learning rate between $10^{-8}$ and $10^{-11}$. How many episodes does it take to converge? Can the resulting policy (which is stochastic) balance the pendulum appropriately? (note you may want to test several times due to the stochasticity). Plot the learning progress (costs versus episodes), you may also want to use a moving average over the costs to remove noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) implement the REINFORCE algorithm with baseline and answer the same questions as in c) (also use an order p=2 for the value function approximation). Additionally, plot the value function. Hint: you may want to choose a learning rate between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-9}$ for updating the policy and a learning rate between $10^{-1}$ and $10^{-3}$ to update the value function.\n",
